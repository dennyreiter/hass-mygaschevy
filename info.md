# Home Assistant My Gas Chevrolet
This is a modification of the My Chevrolet Integration from Home Assistant.  While I do not has an electric vehicle (EV), I do have a gas Chrevolet that uses the My Chevrolet app.  With a little bit of fiddling, it is possible to retrieve the gas-related inforation, so I can track my fuel economy, and how much gas I have left.
